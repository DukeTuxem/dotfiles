# The `plugin` directory

### Usage

> "Vim's functionality can be extended by adding plugins.  A plugin is nothing
more than a Vim script file that is loaded automatically when Vim starts.  You
can add a plugin very easily by dropping it in your plugin directory.
" [:h plugin]()

### In my case

Since I chose to manage my vim configuration using a modular approach,
I guess this directory won't be used that much.

One example that comes to my mind though:
It could be interesting to comment out much of the vimrc configuration, and
simply throw a script in this directory for testing in an isolated manner.
