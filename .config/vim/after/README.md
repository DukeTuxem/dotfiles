# The `after` directory

### Usage

Everything in the after directory will be loaded after everything else.

From there, you can override anything you want:
indentation, filetype plugins, or even the external plugins youâ€™ve installed.

For example, I can override Lisp indentation by creating the file
`after/indent/lisp.vim` and setting whatever options or variables
I want to modify.
